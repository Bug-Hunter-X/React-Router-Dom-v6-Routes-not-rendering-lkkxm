# React Router Dom v6 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: routes failing to render components despite seemingly correct configuration.  The problem, and its solution, are detailed below.

## Problem

The `App.js` file contains a standard React Router v6 setup.  Routes are defined for '/', '/about', and '/contact', each linking to a respective component (not included for brevity). However, none of the components render; the page remains blank.  The browser console shows no errors.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `AppSolution.js`, involves ensuring the correct import statements and verifying the structure of your routes.  A key aspect is to use the `element` prop within the `<Route>` component correctly.  See `AppSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Observe the behavior of `App.js` (the buggy code) and then the corrected functionality of `AppSolution.js`.
